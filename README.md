The code could be hard to read and the API can be outdated, especially those related to `qiskit.ignis`

You may need to change `qiskit.ignis.mitigation.measurement` to `qiskit.utils.mitigation`

PLEASE go to [![this repo](https://github.com/QCOL-LU/Bayesian-Error-Characterization-and-Mitigation) to see a updated code


Note that all files in QREM folder are from the repo https://github.com/fbm2718/QREM. I put the file here just to make sure when other people want to replicate our experiment, they use the same version of the error filters as we did.
