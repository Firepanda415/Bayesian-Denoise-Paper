This paper is just for storing paper data and code, the code could be hard to read and the API can be outdated, especially those related to `qiskit.ignis`, you may need to change `qiskit.ignis.mitigation.measurement` to `qiskit.utils.mitigation`

Note that all files in QREM folder are from the repo https://github.com/fbm2718/QREM. I put the file here just to make sure when other people want to replicate our experiment, they use the same version of the error filters as we did.
